But seriously, great spot in Kendall Sq that usually has lines out the door on the weekday lunch crowd. I am religious on getting the spicy chicken shawarma rice plate (rice pilaf). The hummus is super authentic and I usually get the tabbouleh or the fattoush. I wish the fattoush was a bit more crunchy / crispy but still great. The best part of this place though, is there sauces. I can’t just choose one I go all in on the tahini, the house special pink spicy sauce, and their garlic sauce which you can usually just douse on top.\n\nGreat place for Middle Eastern cuisine and fast!\n\nFollow me on IG for more recs @sophiaeaaats !","time":1621639211,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Luis Cal García","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111713291788481739870/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnsMPpYB1ZqAmMQEJq5zgty7tWU7VJLB-C04XOj=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Great place to have a quick bite with many Mediterranean healthy options.
