When i entered there was a heavy set man sitting infront of an antique cash register. He never even greeted me but when others came in after me, he greeted them (hmmm?). The place was clean which was a plus. I ordered a breakfast plate (scrambled eggs/cheese, homefries, bacon and toast (it came with a drink) It came out fast and i brought it back to my car to eat (I wasnt sitting somewhere i wasnt welcomed). The food was disgusting...no flavor what so ever! Even the bacon had no bacon flavor and the homefries were boiled potatoes diced up. There was a whole potato stem in my homefries that clearly shows be it wasn't cleaned and prepped well. I threw the whole thing away. I never knew breakfast could taste bad until now. I definitely will not go back for sure. Zero stars if i could.","time":1662039636,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jose Crosby","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116287784877028073397/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnfmytUJJG04CjpkNOtdlh9VByaVXt-bMT3XNND4Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Simply delicious!
