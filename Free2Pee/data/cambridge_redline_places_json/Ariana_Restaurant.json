Ate so much of steamed dough that made me feel sick.\n\nPumpkin & eggplant rice - okayish. Eggplant was soaking in oil.\n\nWe were charged 50 bucks for non tasty food and walked out hungry. I’d definitely go to a fine dining restaurant and have filling & delicious meal for about the same cost.\n\nNo vegan food available.\n\nWe were served some flatbread and sauces as starter.
