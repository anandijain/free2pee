It is a not very big but very nice place. The decoration is simple and everything is very clean. It is a busy place and very well accepted by local people. Although there were people, the service was quite fast. The menu is quite extensive, and it is difficult to choose because all their food options are very rich. Everything that was ordered came to the table pretty quickly. Everything was very tasty. Maybe the only thing I didn't love was my iced tea, it tasted a bit like tap water and they don't have sweetened tea, I regularly order half and half.

The sad thing is the food is not as good as it used to be. The poached eggs were cold and yolks were hard. The corned beef hash was pasty and had an  unpleasant texture. Often corned beef is salty but this pasty corned beef had no seasoning and was bland. It was not cold but was room temperature, definitely not hot. The English muffin was barely toasted and was soft. The hollandaise sauce was also not hot and worse, was thickened with ?flour, had no buttery or lemony taste and was bland.
