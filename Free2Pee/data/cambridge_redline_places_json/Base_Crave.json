The spice isn’t overwhelming and compliments the dishes well. The chai tea was also delicious and served steaming hot. The garlic naan seems to be made in house and served sliced into bite size pieces for easier eating.\n\nThe attention to detail in the food is definitely something that I look for when dining out and they truly have a fantastic chef and menu.","time":1640632807,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mona Z.","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103633718944160488835/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp57yl-mS8zax8LrHLVv5rubLmelLOfXWhm5cCTY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"I went to Base Crave for the first time recently and was blown away by how delicious everything was!
