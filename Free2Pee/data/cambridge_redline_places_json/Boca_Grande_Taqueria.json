the food was fresh just by the taste I ate one big burrito and ordered 2 more to go. the service was great and very fast you don't wait long and you watch them make your food right in front of you

I think the burrito was pretty good and as you'd expect. I like having tofu as an option and I think that tasted really good. I think if I ate inside and had hot sauce, it would have tasted a lot better. Asked for hot sauce inside, but it tasted a bit bland... Would be an easy fix if there was more hot sauce inside the burrito\n\nThe taco was pretty soggy despite picking it up almost immediately. It was hard to eat and the paper it was wrapped in also got soggy and made it hard to pickup.\n\nI'd give this another shot with indoor seating after","time":1621266319,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vines","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101169335678183350822/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCkwB_cOKX4YiXfMaENv0esjHhHVI2aO3fY-5TzW=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 weeks ago","text":"Would not recommend this place, the workers were extremely rude and the burrito was not good, too much money for a small portion size.","time":1674068131,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Steve T","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113093568578327460122/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCngCYumI6zv5VAptGs53hkI9x3TXOq9CeCjoHmKiQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Best burritos I‚Äôve ever had.
