First of all, I loved how they wrapped the entire box to prevent any moisture from getting out. Even by the time I got home, chicken was still hot and tender. It would’ve been better if they didn’t season the chicken too much, but I still liked the overall taste of the chicken. If you’re going for the chicken, definitely recommend getting some rice to go along with it - it would make a perfect balance. Everything else on the menu also seemed very affordable and I would definitely return to try their bowls and ramen.","time":1619611418,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Allison Browne","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111253591472186447551/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCkcCEFyT49BA2B7Dgih4LWIwHWPI4i3nhiSor0W=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Great food!
