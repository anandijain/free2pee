To start with we had takoyaki, spicy wings and strips and spicy fried squid. The hotter the better am I right?!\n\nThe takoyaki practically melted in my mouth and each bite was just delicious. Bites of octopus, so yummy.\n\nThe wings and strips were so good! I’ve never had the strips and highly recommend them! Perfectly fried, not fried and full of flavor and spice.\n\nTheir calamari was okay, I personally don’t like sauce on my calamari. I’m more of a sauce on the side kind of person.

After walking down to the basement, with a disabled elderly, we saw another posting that says it is \"takeout only\" scribbled on a paper while the tables and chairs are stacked and pushed aside. The in pickup desk barricaded their glass front.\n\nI hate their misleading and cheapened operation. Literally it is a mere hole in the wall type of cheap setting at best in a sterile basement.
