First time I noticed it at the store and was told \"we can't do anything about it, we made it according to the app\". Second time, I checked one of my burgers which was made according to my order. After I left I found that the second one wasn't! Somehow they decided that of a two burger deal, the order mods only applied to one burger! To boot I didn't even receive a patty and I waited 10 minutes while people who ordered after me got their food. What's up with this BK?\n\nOriginal:\n\nThe employees here give fast and accurate service which is always great with fast food. Place seems clean and the cashiers usually have a quick chat with me which is nice. They're very friendly! Sometimes though the line gets really backed up and they only have one person on register.","time":1576790216,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Malcolm Mayfield","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107213655196840781631/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnAjJ4jpl1u3he2E37RToZQyLWj9eWfjoMQ3uh0L7o=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I looked up the menu ahead of time and saw a \"you way combo\" so I ordered that to see if I could get back into Burger King... I also ordered another item, both while starting at the \"featured\" section of the menu. There were no nuggets in the bag although I said bbq sauce. When I returned, she told me I needed to give her a code at the time of purchase and bc I failed to do that there was nothing she could do. I only came here to literally try to get into Burger King again so I wanted to try it and for $6 it made sense. Without the nuggets, I would've went to Chiang Mai Thai next door, who practically gives away food. Nothing on the menu indicate the need for a code of for it to be online only. So I guess the customer service end it for burger king.
