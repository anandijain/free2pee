You won’t really find a small restaurant serving food like this anywhere else in Boston. The flavors seriously hit the spot and everything is just made so, so well. I personally love the tonkatsu—the meat inside is always juicy with the perfect crispy and thin breading around it. Value is SO worth it too! For just $12 you basically get a full bento box: miso soup, salad, rice, tonkatsu, and curry. Rice is a bit too mushy to my liking but otherwise everything was great.
