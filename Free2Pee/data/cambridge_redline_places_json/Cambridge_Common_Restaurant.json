Good selection of beers and drinks and excellent quality-price food options. We enjoyed very much the outdoor seating on a summer night. The greek salad with grilled chicken was very good (although traditional greek salads do not have lettuce in my book). Fish and chips and burgers were great options too. Generous portions. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Prices are more than fair. It was busy, so you may have to wait a bit.\n\nBonus: I particularly liked that their terminals to pay by card because the device allows you to split the bill in as many people as you want, each person choosing how much they want to tip.
