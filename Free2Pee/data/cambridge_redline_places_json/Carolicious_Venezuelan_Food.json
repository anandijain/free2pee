We heard about this restaurant by word of mouth, and I can see why. This restaurant is tucked away in a corner of the town and down an obscure road that no one would find. This unexpected hidden gem is well worth your time!\n\nWe ordered the Pelua (spiced beef + cheese) and Pork + Pico de Gallo Arepas as well as the Pork Pabellon bowl. The Arepas were fantastic! The beef + cheese arepa satisfied those salty/meaty/cheesy cravings while the pork + pico de gallo was more refreshing. We loved both of them so much. For people who don’t know what an arepa is, it is like a taco sandwich (analogies won’t do this description justice, just try it). With either pork or beef sandwiched between a cornmeal “bun”, the arepa is a fantastic and fun dish that I think people will enjoy!\n\nThe bowl was a surprisingly large amount of food for the price, certainly a great deal for all the ingredients included, and had all the same flavors as the arepas. While it was also excellent, we definitely preferred the arepas and will order more of them in the future.\n\nWe loved the artistic and relaxed vibe of the courtyard and will certainly return in the future. It is an excellent place to visit with friends and family or on a date! This place is a hidden restaurant wonder and we highly recommend it!!","time":1631582879,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Josh G","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117776785546921245077/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp7-feRqydDNkGh0R-_iox0c_Wsz8E3tRjTu5Pa5=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Absolutely incredible food.
