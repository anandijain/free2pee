shareable portions. I was particularly impressed with the pork hock which was a huge chunk of crispy and tender pork meat that looked quite similar to the German Schweinshaxe. However, the red cabbage wraps and the chili sauce on the side made it a unique experience. Other standout dishes include the baby ribs and the crab pong sari. Crispy pork belly was also nice, but it wasn’t as interesting as the other two.\nDefinitely recommend checking them out for big group gatherings.","time":1646777981,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Carnival of Flavors","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101134054973334846807/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmzw2kWNjDCf2UJw1izaJ44YjkSvM27ib1iabpyazc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"11 months ago","text":"A comfy place with a unique Asian menu. A lot of items listed on a menu needed to be googled as non Asians wouldn’t know what they are. The appetizers were not that great however we loved the main course. For appetizers, we ordered chicken betel leaf and scallops. The chicken fish had a very strong zingy taste and I’m not sure what that was. Scallops were okay. For main course I ordered stir fry snapper and it was amazing.
