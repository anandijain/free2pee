First and foremost itâ€™s being sanitary and clean!\n\nI placed an order for a chicken teriyaki sub which tasted anything but. There was so much mayo on the sandwich that it was practically soaking.\n\nMy biggest concern is the fact that the spices and sauces that are located at the end of the line, is also being used by the guy who is prepping my food. I noticed that earlier a construction guy grabbed the sirracha bottle with his hand (probably not washed) and then the same guy in the kitchen grabbed the bottle with gloves on to drizzle the sauce on the sandwich he was prepping. Why donâ€™t they have their own bottle. This was disgusting and a health risk.\n\nWill not be returning!","time":1565202014,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jasmine Liu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116950773568939628061/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5vdtbadI1-USpJS3mQMV-F71WkAghXZtvaQwOJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"I visit this place once a week, and this is my favorite take out spot.
