I thought it didn't exist here until one day I found this place.\n\nThe food is hot and spicy - they don't ask for spice level preference, and I like it this way - who has chicken chili or triple schezwan fried rice with less spice. The flavour profile reminds of street food you'd have in India.\n\nIf you're some one like me who's spent a better part of their life in India and misses the all too common fried rice, hakka noodles and some chili and lollipops, this is the place to be.

I don’t get why the giant side of rice was necessary. My daughter hypothesized that the large section of the plate used to be for the entrée but they decided to cheapen things up and use a smaller compartment for the item that didn’t cost next to nothing. What they call a salad is actually some expired lettuce. When you ask for a cup of water, the cup they give you is basically the size of a large thimble. It’s hard to say if I would go back as the entrée was great but the rest was a disappointment and the pricing is what you would’ve expected at a full-service restaurant. Oh, I should also mention that the garlic naan was good.","time":1647693737,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Boss Blue","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109611710934020670647/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnnCduYoVW8V4CC0UecE8EXIkOLsgQvGcDj6x5d=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"This is a great spot with a lot of options!
