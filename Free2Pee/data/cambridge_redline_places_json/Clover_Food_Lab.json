We came for lunch in December 30th and it wasn’t the best service. The staff had some normal hiccups and confusion regarding our order, but the really sad part is that we found a hair in one of our sandwiches. I don’t think this was an unavoidable mistake, given how the staff was wearing their hair nets. I took a picture of one person, but there were at least three people not wearing a hair net at all or wearing it in a “symbolic” way. I do appreciate you guys being open on the Friday after the holidays, but if it means slacking on the quality of the service, you might want to rethink that.","time":1672425558,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Dustin Wilson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115317588386043424326/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnNLb3nonewb8F1pQpI04L-1jGmwldfBUyaHe2zUA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Amazing find! Not being from Boston I was glad to stumble across this place. I walked in and was greeted by Kevin and the staff here, very kind and extremely knowledgeable about the food they prepared. He explained the different menu items and what they were off the top of his head, and showed me how to order correctly from their website.\n\nI placed an order and it was ready within 8 minutes of placing it. I got a chance to stay outside and smell the deliciousness they were cooking (while even still wearing a mask)\n\nThe food itself was amazing. I ordered the Chickpea fritter as per their suggestion (first time I’ve eaten chickpea) and it was so good. Paired with their French fries with rosemary and vanilla soda, it was so worth the price.\n\nAbsolutely delicious!","time":1618863939,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kevin Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101255040320384822824/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCkMdDRG6jM6l1ELbDCB5vcbTuVmKw1_Q9mh9cubvU4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Great experience at this Cambridge staple full of fresh food options for a variety of lifestyles.

Saw Clover ( never saw one before ) and decided to try it out after looking over the menu. Ordered 1 Chickpea Fritter Plater, 2 Heirloom Tomato Sandwiches and 1 fried potatoes order. Also had 1 side boiled egg.\nI personally didn't taste the player but, looking at it the presentation was very nice. I was told it was very good and tasted great. I did have the pickles off the player and they were very good tasting pickles.\nI had 1 of the Heirloom Tomato Sandwiches. It came on a warm pita bread with mayonnaise, lattice and some type of cheese ( I actually don't recall what type of cheese ). The sandwich was very good. I would definitely get it again. I am sure it's seasonal because the tomato tasted vine ripe.\nThe fries were also very good.
