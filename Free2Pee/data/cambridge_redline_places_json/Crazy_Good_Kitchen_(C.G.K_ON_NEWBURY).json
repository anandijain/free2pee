I couldn't resist and had to try it and I'm glad I came to check them out. They offer seating inside and on outside, plenty of space both in and outdoor. The waiter was really nice and attentive.\nI'm not really a burger person but their burger was very good. We had the Hot Mess & Cheese burger. It was perfectly cooked alittle to cheese for me. We also had the Bacon Bird chicken sandwich spicy but I would recommend getting it classic. It's so spicy that you can't even taste the sandwich. For drinks I had a Sangria and my son the Nutella & Banana Milkshake. Both drinks were pretty good. I would definitely got back to try other things specially the cocktails. I would highly recommend for kids and teenagers.","time":1656587991,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jasmine","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114214057236427049096/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5UnxBTIGlWEwQ94vpJt9kSOMgwZwL9ixpUMQlfBA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Leaving 4 stars simply because of the lack of vegetarian options… there are only two (For The Veggie Friend and The Parmesan Truffle Fries) and they unfortunately don’t allow you to swap the meat patties for the bean patty in any of their burger options.

This guy was made smash patty-style and topped with shaved steak. All their meat is ground daily and was super juicy and a nice medium cook. The cheese was melted into the patty so that you got cheese and sauce in every bite! They also have burger and fried chicken sandwich options that are less intimidating than this one (but just as good!). Fries were not as amazing as the burger or milkshake, but they were a generous portion size and the cheese and steak on them were super tasty.\n\nI also highly recommend their milkshakes. Not watery but not so thick that you can’t drink them, creamy but not overly sweet; the cookies-flavored one we got had a really prominent cookie dough flavor!\n\n📸: Hot Mess & Cheese burger, Crazy for Cookies milkshake, Steak and Cheese fries","time":1644467467,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Trupti Raut","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115989433199460939807/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClVRX4BBgLG6JRMZbt2rRdU4b07kcalP4o4KTYgw4M=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"What we ate:\n1.

She knew how to be efficient and juggle from one customer to the next at the bar, never gone or ignored for too long.\n\nSo good burgers. Good shakes. Good service.
