Very fast delivery. Asked for everything to be extra spicy and they delivered and it tasted authentic. Has a lot of Indian food in the city, and this is one of the best. Also great for cost compared to other options since they have a giant menu and much better prices compared to others.\n\nI ordered veg momos, samosas, chili paneer, Gobi 65, Laso Gobi, and samosa chaat. Gobi 65 was my favorite since it was fried perfectly with the kick from the extra hot red chilis. Really enjoyed every thing else too so highly recommend. Laso Gobi tasted good, samosa chaat was a bit different take than typical restaurants and also had a bhel puri esque topping. That was a welcome surprise. Samosa is standard, and I got the veg memos as making it different compared to other Indian restaurants. They come with two dipping sauces that are different form typical Indian dips. I thought the chili paneer was a bit oily but still good overall.","time":1619800067,"translated":false},{"author_name":"mateo toro","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113080911913306628300/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCna9qkxkMxRuOoID8Bsa91AFH9GujdaQ2xFW7emmA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"I had a huge craving for curry when I was in Boston this past weekend.
