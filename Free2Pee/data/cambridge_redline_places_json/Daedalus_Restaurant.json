I’ll have to go back to see if he was right, but the pork was absurdly good. It was juicy and well-seasoned, and came with potatoes and two veggies, all of which were perfectly seasoned, tasty, and hot.\n\nI was about 3 minutes from done eating when a party of 11 came in to the then-empty downstairs so I waited a little longer than I preferred until he returned, but he came back to check on me immediately after the large party was served their drinks.\n\nAt that point, I ordered the chocolate cake, subbing the coconut ice cream for vanilla, as I have a near-allergy condition (oral allergy syndrome) which makes coconut a bad idea for me. Unfortunately for me, the server came back from the kitchen and told me there was cross contamination between the cake and the coconut, and wasn’t comfortable serving me cake even though I explained my (non-deadly, but unpleasant) condition more clearly to him, and indicated that I could consume coconut as long as it wasn’t an ingredient I would at worst have an unpleasant evening.\n\nAnyways, while I would have loved to try the cake, I VERY much appreciate the server’s attention to detail and concern for my safety. On the whole, the food was excellent, service was very good, and the vibes were pleasant.\n\nI will definitely be back, but I certainly hope that by that point the coconut ice cream is in the trash, where it belongs, and the dessert menu contains at least two choices of chocolate dessert without nuts or coffee of any kind spoiling them!","time":1676001497,"translated":false},{"author_name":"César Rincón Mayorga","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114140953280193118652/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCm_ayK5x6EYxbtOXEQoQPwtGe_-ikn-fsGYSANsDP4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"I loved this place.
