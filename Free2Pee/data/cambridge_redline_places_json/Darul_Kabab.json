I got 5 chunks of rubber with pita and... a collection of random vegetables that are completely raw and inedible as a \"salad\".  I added with the meat and pita but I paid 17 dollars for something that should have cost 6-8 dollars.  I am not exaggerating, my jaw HURT after chewing these pieces of meat.\n\nBathroom was sticky and dirty.  Food was slow.  Service was poor.  And it appeared the owners were sitting at a table and just chilling out and eating food while we sat and waited half an hour for garbage food in a practically empty restaurant.\n\nHonestly all of that was super disappointing but I would have just moved on and forgotten about it.\n\nBut my friend found a piece of either bone or porcelain in his pita about the size of a marble.\n\nGLASS IN HIS PITA.  HE WAS SERVED A PIECE OF GLASS IN HIS FOOD.\n\nThis place doesn't deserve a bad review.  It should be shut down.  I've found gum in my food at a restaurant before, and this experience was WORSE.\n\nDO NOT EAT HERE.","time":1637445709,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Arusha Acharyya","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107584337784271175939/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnGNpguAcOJOB5CeZiK1WZW7mf3SGUx2b0lSctENA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Good place to have Bengali food in the Boston neighborhood.

As for the appetizer was the cauliflower soaked in this savory sauce that made me devoured in a minute like I never ate before. God knows how much I have dined all my life at amazing restaurants but this new chef they have is genius in what he does. He also wait on table when he has 2.
