My several pick up experience in the past was not very pleasant, but I was glad to find out that their service is now miles better than what it used to be during the pandemic. This time I got the grilled octopus, baked lamb, and the lavraki.\n\nThe food was still basic as the seasoning for most of the dishes were limited to olive oil and lemon juice. Yet, they were great representations of Greek and Mediterranean style of cooking, and I enjoyed their simplicity. The baked lamb was our favorite as its tender pieces of meat fell right off the bone. The sauce also added a good amount of acidity that went well with the baked potatoes on the side.\n\nPast review\n\nRecently picked up their lamb kebob with a side of gratis Greek salad. While waiting for pickup, I watched how they cook their kebobs, and instead of the traditional oven method, they put the skewers on a grill and unloaded all the meats from the skewers half-way. I was initially unsure whether it would taste good, but the meats were cooked perfectly medium. However, their service was extremely slow and the food wasn’t ready by the estimated time.","time":1658713962,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kati Vu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113389643909267177847/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmFsIc5NBaRSt7o5G7D4uzAhPdYrPSzhdJlSPs_Rck=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Desfina is like a hidden gem of Cambridge!
