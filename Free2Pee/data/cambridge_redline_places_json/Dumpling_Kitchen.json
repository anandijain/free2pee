The fried rice is terrible while the general tso's tofu is acceptable.\n\nThe pineapple fried rice uses a curry base to add flavor to the rice. Instead of seasoning the rice, it seems a curry brick was used as a shortcut to add flavor. It doesn't taste good. Combined with too sweet canned pineapple, the dish is borderline more sweet than savory. At least the portion is huge.\n\nThe tofu in the general tso's tofu (vegan) is of the fried variety. It is a little tough but the flavor is probably what you'd expect if you order it. There should definitely be more broccoli than the 4 pieces we got.","time":1671199972,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sharon Lalonde","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105261031684567612397/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp7bbo4nHJOLSycswlcj2xb6u0e6Hbegq9NJtXoy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"These are NOT the crab rangoons you are looking for.
