The chicken nachos plate with refried beans and guac. Was fantastic, plenty of chicken & the nachos were nice & crispy. Guac was really good nice and fresh. The sweet potato fries were good too. The chili lime beef Crunchwrap was delicious had plenty of flavor. Overall great spot for drinks and food.

Not the best place in Davis square. The food was ok and their portions are small for the price tag. Got a fish and chips for example, and it was barely a quarter of a fish. We also ordered a jar of sangria that said “4 to 6” cups but from the jar we could barely fill two and a half cups. We asked the staff and they said basically that if we didn’t fill the glasses too much and put ice on the cup we would make up to 6 cups.

After waiting close to an hour without anyone noticing that our table was still empty, we asked the waitress about it, only to find out that the kitchen lost our order.
