The spinach pie (one for $3.29) is just bread dough - no phyllo dough and no cheese (to be fair, the description does not say cheese but its clearly in the picture). My order was also supposed to have a pumpkin kebbe ball and I got something totally different (Grape leaves? See picture - also $3.29 for one). Finally both were totally, out-of-the-refrigerator cold. The wraps were fine (and warm) but were 50% pit and I dont think the chicken \"shawarma\" is prepared like actual shawarma - its just shredded chicken with sauce. Unfortunately, not worth it relative to other area offerings like Aceituna.","time":1656199106,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jodie Zalk","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102917713900535933459/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnT6jRpEl_HZjbH3PzhH6NK5urQppk_xMod7H-2rw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"11 months ago","text":"What a feast we had! Everything looked so good, it was hard to decide what to try so we ordered lots of different things, and we enjoyed all of them! We ordered some standard favorites --  tabouli, white bean salad, hummus, mouhamara,  spinach pie, and fattoush salad...and tried some new things too -- quinoa salad, eech, and pumpkin kebbe. We loved it all! Everything tasted incredibly fresh and flavorful! It's hard to say which was my favorite -- I have two: the fattoush salad (they put on top some rolled-up crunchy pita chips that are flavored with zaatar) and the pumpkin kebbe (I loved all the different flavors all together -- the spinach, lemon, and pumpkin), and Nick liked the mouhamara best.\n\nMy favorite part was that they gave us small bites of a new dessert they will add to the menu soon. I don't know what it's called, but it was a soft dough stuffed with sweet cheese. (Almost like a blintz but different dough.) Delicious!\n\nThank you, Nina and Jack! You were very kind to us, and the food is delicious!
