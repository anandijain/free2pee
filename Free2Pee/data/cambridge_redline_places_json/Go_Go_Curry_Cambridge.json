Shrimp tempura was the same but a bit greasy. The curry had great flavor and a bit of a kick, which perfectly enhances the flavors of all the other elements on the plate. Sausage had the crunch and was super juicy. Slaw was a good break from all the flavors and fried food.\n\nThe curry dish was a great meal overall.\n\nUnlike many of the other reviews, I think this place is pretty solid (I've only been here a couple times as of this review). The prices are pretty good and the meal is satisfying and tasty. I call that a win in my books. The food also comes out relatively quick (depending on the traffic) and the seating area is decently clean.\n\nKeep in mind, the Go Go Curry is in Hmart, so it's not necessarily the place you take someone visiting the area. But it definitely is a great spot for a quick lunch or dinner if you're nearby.","time":1672798022,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jea Kim","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117730837401207768949/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmswfTg1g2YtaumI-HxIKqWa3kjLzTvtRfMq-MoZQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Decent Japanese katsu and curry chain located inside Hmart.\nRecently got a takeout of their grand slam curry. I liked how they offered a wide variety in one menu, and it was perfect for indecisive people like myself. The combination of pork and chicken katsu, shrimp tempura, and sausages was well sorted, and the portion was huge for the price.\nI grew up eating a lot of Japanese katsu and curry, and this was unfortunately on the lower quality side. Curry wasn’t so flattering, meat portions of the katsu were too thin, and the cabbage salad had a coarse texture which I never experienced. However, with a lack of good Japanese food options in Cambridge, this place is still a decent option if you’re craving for some katsu and curry.","time":1640582946,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Storm","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107780920251393585972/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp7nVY_VQv_CRM3EoWExaaOgWxKgDFxPbe2Prhb1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"A great place to curb your tonkatsu craving right before shopping in hmart.

We went on a Sunday at lunchtime, so it was quite busy since that's a popular grocery shopping time.\n\nThere aren't a lot of options at this H Mart food court, so I decided to give Go Go Curry a chance simply because I haven't tried it before. However, from now on I'll definitely be sticking to the ramen counter next door.\n\nThere are a decent number of curry options with pork, chicken, shrimp, fish, or tofu. However, they all use the pork curry, so you have to specifically request it if you want the veggie curry.\n\nI ordered the fish katsu. The katsu itself was fine, and the curry had a bit of a kick but was not particularly tasty. It's served on white rice and raw cabbage - don't expect a lot of rice, and the salad is neither fresh nor good.\n\nA definite 1-star. It wasn't cheap enough to warrant spending the price of a meal on food that wasn't very good, and I left still hungry.
