tried a bunch of things and our favorite was the Orange line chicken with rice. Will definitely be back to get that  again! And the dumplings of course (Just as good as Wangs dumplings I swear- Which are the real deal and if you can eat gluten get over there to get some of the leek dumplings ASAP, you won’t be disappointed. We used to get a bag of frozen dumplings - 50 for $13, not sure if they still sell those ).\n\nI love that they have eco-friendly packaging and a deal where you can trade in a glass container. I always really appreciate this when restaurants follow through from start to finish regarding environmental concerns.\n\nLooking forward to trying the tacos next time.","time":1630624024,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alexa D","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104305219916831811015/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCknWFiQ0hy1rVUi6hFL50-rIKqcpkY4WBoFCr0KWQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Ordered takeout for the first time tonight after thinking about trying this place out for a while. Honestly I was not super impressed by their food - I ordered a rice noodle dish and it was a smaller portion than expected given the price tag. Other BYO noodle/salad places in Boston give much more food at the same price point. The dish itself wasn't bad, it was just pretty bland and the sauce was watery. I ordered sweet chili sauce as a garnish and they added way too much to the dish so I had to try and wipe some of it off before eating. They also added vegetables to my order that I did not request.","time":1665786906,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kara D","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110799571108089792144/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5r18Lo3ln4_Z4ykEcSFqCkOSPcvuyA4vHzqh28tw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Disappointing.
