We went with a group of 6 and we were all a bit surprised by how good the food was.  I think our initial impression was due to there being a pop-up thrift shop right when you walk in, but if you move beyond that and take a table and eat your experience will be different.\n\nWe really liked our waitress, she was sweet and friendly.  We also had the impossible chili, the tuna salad, the southwest salad, a chicken caesar wrap, a burger, chicken tenders with fries and bangers and mash.  I am a bit crazy about chicken and it not being chewy and this was fresh, grilled chicken. My husband is British and was so excited that these were the sausages just like in London and actually wanted to know where they were purchased. It was good, classic American diner style food but it was all so fresh and delicious.  I would absolutely go back and dine here again.","time":1616187310,"translated":false},{"author_name":"G D","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111872378064883959928/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmd7JtSNvaSR6CMlkAS-NQWrena24f-c7jFykKrSQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Just ok for me.
