Really blown away by the small plates, we had crispy pork belly and lamb chops and golf shrimp. The lamb chops were the best. However everyone was in the little heavy on the salty side. For the large plate we had the sword fish which was okay. The lentil soup with sweet potatoes was refreshing but again was on the more saltier side.\nThe restaurant was fully packed on the Saturday evening and we sat in the patio. The ambience was nice and the staff were courteous and friendly.

The quantity is fine and location is perfect. Make sure you book them a day prior. They also have parking behind the restaurant. I wish they had more vegetarian options though, especially for small and large plates.\nService was a bit slow but we were told that they're short of staff. Staff is friendly. Overall I liked the place. It can be a bit pricey since the portion size isn't much, so you tend to order more. Definitely try the spinach empinadas. It's not on the menu but asked them about it.
