I was astounded I hadn’t found the place before, as they are some of the best Chinese food I’ve had in Boston, if not the best, especially for the price.\n\nThe orange chicken is solid. It contains a lot more meat per piece than most places, and the flavor was excellent. The portion sizes are massive for the prices, and I’ve been very impressed both the first and second time I’ve gone here. I definitely will return.\n\nEven if I wasn’t impressed by the quality of the food, the price for the amount you’re getting is VERY good.
