The food and the service was really horrible. The staff was rude and didn’t care if the food served was good or not. I know Indian cuisine and have been eating it since childhood, the quality of food was horrible and the ingredients were far from fresh. Would never recommend this place. I know the restaurant can handle the loss of one customer, just wanted to share my experience. The student offer was just for show. The waiter gave me the entire bill and said he forgot to include the discount, so to balance it please don’t give any tips, as if I wanted give them any tip for their service. The worst part was I couldn’t even finish the food not because of the size of the portion but because of the taste, felt really bad to waste so much food. Didn’t want to embarrass other customers so paid the bill quietly and left. Was actually a waste of money.\n\nI was particularly disappointed by the staff, one staff member making weird faces while informing the other member that “this dude didn’t like the food (in Hindi)” while I was looking at him. Could go on and on and on about this experience. I hope the owner reads this and would at least ask the staff to be kind and professional to all the customers and not just local visitors.","time":1664684060,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Joy Leonard","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111231975903296085057/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp4wiaibPJ-eqiXCv34SICFj-Om1RYSk4m6DZjH9=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I have been a frequent customer here for over a year now.
