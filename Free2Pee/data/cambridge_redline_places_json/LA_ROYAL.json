I was very impressed with this restaurant. The staff were all very attentive to us and the other diners. Our server was Evan, he was very friendly, knowledgeable and just seemed very happy we were there. Evan was engaging and helped us with the menu choices. A very nice guy to be sure. I was a bit lost with the menu but Evan didn't rush us.\n\nThe food:\nSuperb. We all shared our dishes with each other to enjoy the variety offered. I ordered an Alpaca burger. You'd think a place like this would've not had a burger but this was no ordinary burger.. They didn't give ketchup with the burger but it did include a small bowl of some dip. I didn't use that but started on the burger as it was. HOLY COW!! This was the BEST burger I've ever had (and I've had a lot of burgers in my time). Sooo tasty, sweet even. I can't do it justice. The appetizers were fantastic, everyone's food was top notch.\nDrinks were all interesting and tasty. We also ordered a pitcher of brewed purple corn? That was a unique taste.\n\nThe total for the 4 of us was about $250 give or take. That's pretty normal for the four of us. There was a 3% gratuity to the kitchen workers which they definitely deserved.\n\nAll in all it was a super night, definitely worth a return trip!!","time":1657855829,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jelena Djokic","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100792750490726967383/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCl_ceoGaVSOtJSdaYOCHcPv8IUy6-f_DVsXjfnmfw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This was perfect!

Gorgeous room. Service friendly but maybe understaffed during dinner rush - we were scurried to our table without much of a welcome and orders were taken briskly. In any case the drinks and food were great. Scallops au gratin were succulent. Duck breast was wonderfully tender although the cilantro rice was soggy and a bit bland. Branzino was awesome. Beware the room can get almost unbearably noisy - on top of the loud music we were unfortunately sandwiched between a group of six and a group of three - essentially had to lean on and shout across the table with my companion. I'd come back to try the rest of the menu but maybe at lunch time or a weekday night.","time":1661655550,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kobi","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106407405782006218245/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp7S3GaZ6D-w-cNqdEf4Xz_zmXYTPUYI8UWyOljd=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Amazing every single time!!

The mezcal Negroni is really strong - strong flavors - if you like that - go for that too! You can’T go wrong! Highlights from our most recent meal there: grilled octopus potato terrine, arugula and watercress salad, the cod, the mussels with shrimp and squid are just incredible!!

That one day came. We made reservations for a Thursday and there was a decent sized crowd. We were seated at their bar. The restaurant itself is a little cramped, but not a big deal at all. It was nice to be able to watch our food being prepared in front of us, although on a warm day the heat from the kitchen is not extremely enjoyable. When we were seated we were given warm water that was sitting in their window sill. I would suggest they move those bottles to a fridge! We ordered a round of drinks, and they were different. Very bitter tasting in my opinion. For dinner itself the leche de Tigre was PHENOMENAL. Would highly recommend as an app. For dinner my boyfriend got the burger and I got the Jalea La Royal. Both were ok. Nothing crazy or over the top. Overall, service was ok, but when we wanted second drinks nobody seemed to pay attention to us. Definitely a one time visit.","time":1655603371,"translated":false}],"serves_beer":true,"serves_dinner":true,"serves_wine":true,"takeout":true,"types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=7359110281675295857","user_ratings_total":99,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"221 Concord Avenue, Cambridge","website":"http://www.laroyalcambridge.com/","wheelchair_accessible_entrance":true},"status":"OK"}
