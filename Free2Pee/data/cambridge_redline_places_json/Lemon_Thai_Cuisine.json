We call or order online & pay then pick up our orders, it's always easy. We've ordered it over a dozen times the past couple of years-always consistent, GREAT food, always very courteous and hard working staff, always very prompt.  It's been terrific.  Some of the things we've tried are their Pad Thai,  Indonesian Rice,  Chicken Satay -all delicious and flavorful.  Much better pad thai than all other places I've tried so far.  The chicken satay is grilled, easy to eat skewers to dip in the accompanying peanut sauce dip.  The Indonesian rice is like nothing I've had anywhere, SO good. It's a gorgeous bed of flavorful rice accompanied by crispy chicken(great crispy chicken!) and/or veggies: broccoli, grean beans, onions, sprouts, baby corn. I absolutely recommend trying things on their menu that sound good to you & enjoy.","time":1603420004,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Katiria Roca","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104485628914197098008/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp4Auhu-uveUbaaN7YqXV12bAfOrqhg6QkH4UeKG=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Best Thai place in the area.
