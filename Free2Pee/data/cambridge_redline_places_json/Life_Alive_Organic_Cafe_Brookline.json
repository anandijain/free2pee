Once I had a Buddha bowl which smelled like hand sanitizer. I also saw another lady throw away her bowl same visit and I was like what’s wrong with people throwing away their food until my own food arrived and I realize oh yeah there’s literally hand sanitizer mixed with everything specially with pomegranate that I added as special request. On the second visit, I asked for iced coffee since Starbucks was closed and I was unwell to walk till Cafe Nero and I decided to get a coffee from this place before going to my physical therapy appointment. Basically I paid $6.5 for a coffee which was so bad that I throw it away after a few sips. What’s more, they don’t have any sort of bakery or pastry while they offer coffee which is rather bizarre. Specially that they have breakfast menu. Adding some pastry/bakeries would improve their quality or I would say removing the coffee altogether from their menu.","time":1660863021,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Daniel Cabada","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108553483470006629365/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClS8HX6X95G6Hen8o7EC5WzJghy5BFk0P-Ns33MD0k=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"What an amazing option for the ones we are vegetarian, vegan and trying to eat healthy food.
