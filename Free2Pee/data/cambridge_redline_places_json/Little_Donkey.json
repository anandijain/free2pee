The atmosphere and ambiance are great. The service and staff were friendly, attentive and lighting fast.\n\nThe food was average, nothing special. The Bangkok Street Noodles were missing a lot of the noodles and more of a salad with peanuts thrown on the side. There was no flavor expect for overdone spice that left your mouth on fire.\n\nThe Pupusa De Pollo was much smaller than expected and again lacked any good flavor.\n\nWe were all shocked when the bill came. The food and drinks are overpriced, bland and nothing special. It’s a big let down as we were very excited to eat here. A majority of the reviews either ignore the overpriced menu or the blandness of the food.\n\nThe food, drinks and prices alone would only be 3 star worthy. However, the staff and atmosphere helped push it to 4 stars. Metered parking along the street, you only have 90 min before you have to give up your seat.\n\nUltimately I wouldn’t come back.","time":1671550727,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jea Kim","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117730837401207768949/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmswfTg1g2YtaumI-HxIKqWa3kjLzTvtRfMq-MoZQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Typical New American restaurant with decent food and service.\n\nMy friend and I came in for dinner this past weekend. We liked the casual and relaxed atmosphere, but it seemed a bit hectic. Our server was busy talking to other diners, so she rarely came by our table to check on us. She was still very friendly but made everything look unorganized.\n\nWhile we weren't able to find anything interesting, standout dishes were the foie gras and the manti. The peach and nut toppings on the foie gras seemed to work better than other fruit and foie gras combinations I've tried. Known as the Turkish dumplings, the manti were also satisfying bites. On the other hand, their iconic caviar sandwich was disappointing. The combination of lukewarm caviar and toasted bun was unremarkable, and it certainly looked better than it tasted. Other dishes including the steak tartare, mussels, and the bronzino were good, but their flavor profiles were a bit cliche.\n\nWithout innovative dishes, Little Donkey certainly fell short compared to other New American restaurantalin the city. However, they are still a solid choice for a casual night out if you don't have a huge expectation for their food.","time":1660851054,"translated":false}],"serves_beer":true,"serves_breakfast":true,"serves_brunch":true,"serves_dinner":true,"serves_lunch":true,"serves_vegetarian_food":true,"serves_wine":true,"takeout":true,"types":["restaurant","bar","point_of_interest","food","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=2442333803552799691","user_ratings_total":1770,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"505 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge","website":"http://www.littledonkeybos.com/?utm_source=local&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb","wheelchair_accessible_entrance":true},"status":"OK"}
