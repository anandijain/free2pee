While they weren’t the most affordable Peruvian food option in the area, they certainly had some great dishes worth trying. The mixed ceviche and lomo saltado were our favorites, and I especially liked the refreshing aftertaste of the ceviche. Tamal was also interesting, but a bit too heavy to be an appetizer. The roasted chicken was just okay, but fortunately, the sauces made them miles better. We also wanted to try the Inca kola and their specialty corn drink, but they were unfortunately stolen by our Grubhub driver. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable dinner overall.","time":1649945495,"translated":false},{"author_name":"孫羽含","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112260140708736144274/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmSwrl78lohQaXr0LwEjm3sboCI6mJ36lijLvPOwg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Came here for rotisserie chicken, it was nicely cooked, very juicy.","time":1661623238,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Y M","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109854274228147202754/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClKAL9Bzpnn7kZTW5aZaekXIWzwkX47K1amSg5pbg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"This place is amazing!

Finally had the opportunity to go and found a good parking spot. Highly recommend to go by public transportation or Lyft to save yourself some trouble.\n\nI ordered the half Peruvian Roasted Chicken that includes 1/4 dark and 1/4 white, I personally like dark meat more, depends on personal taste. The roasted chicken was very rich in flavor, juicy and not heavy. The plantain was delicious with the sauces (spicy and non-spicy) the server gave us. The staff was very friendly and from Honduras. The best part, it was very affordable, about $10/person for a full meal.\n\n.\n.\n🍡Must order🍡\n- fried yucca\n- plantain\n- Peruvian toasted chicken\n.\n.\n📜Score:\n🏝Environment: 3.5⭐️\n👍Services:  5⭐️\n🍽Taste:  4.5⭐️\n💰 Price:  $\n🥇Overall:  4.1⭐️","time":1541977296,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Danny Otero","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101414337563989302190/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCliJWAyQ6NMVV0lQ8dv75icSH-GQd0EdyjEGOmKLro=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 years ago","text":"Love coming here! I was recommended this restaurant a few years ago and haven't stopped coming. I usually order a whole charcoal chicken for about $22. It's like a combo meal and includes white rice and salad. I also order fried sweet plantain, fried casava (yuca) and fries for my girls. All for about $35. They also have 2 or 3 Peruvian beers and wines as well as different natural juices and shakes. Dessert is also good with creamy flan! The only con I can think of are the small tables that can barely fit all the plates but other than that, I highly recommend! MUST TRY THE GREEN SAUCE!!!
