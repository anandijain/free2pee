Hear me out as I explain as a non-Persian diner (1) Their Ash reshteh, which is hard to come by, is yummy, comforting and very filling. (2) All of the kebabs and the meat are flavourful. Even something simple as a grilled chicken is beautifully seasoned. (3) They offer freshly brewed black tea and it’s delicious!!! Do yourself a favour and order it after your meal. (4) There’s Persian ice cream on the menu it’s delightful especially because of the rose & saffron flavour. Lots of pistachios on the outside & inside add texture. (5) There’s tahdig in the appetizer section.
