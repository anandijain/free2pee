While visiting Boston we went to Davis Station to do some shopping and  we got hungry. My son says MOM let's go to this Lil spot on the corner that gives great Italian food.  I said yep let's go!  We chose to sit outside because of the very nice day. A lovely waitress was so kind and accommodating since we had the baby.  The menu was nice and basic but it was just what I wanted.....Pasta!  Well they delivered on the Parmigiano Meatballs which didn't come with Pasta but No problem to add. Son had a meatball Sub.  I ordered chicken noodles soup for starters that my 6 month old grand boy loved.. The plate of Pasta that was brought was large enough to feed 4. I was like... OMG!  We laughed üòÖ and ate! ‚ù§ Ordered a Cocktail Ale with a Great Sugar Rim along with my Pina Colada with real Pineapple Slivers and coconut on the rim EPIC!  The meal was DELICIOUS and Plenty bagged it up and had it for the next day as I took on the plane home lololoololol üòä.
