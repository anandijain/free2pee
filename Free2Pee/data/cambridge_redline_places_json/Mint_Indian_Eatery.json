You can tell the food is made with love and healthy ingredients. But, one spoon of mild chicken Biryani and I could not feel my mouth anymore! There were also a lot of spices just floating around in the food that got me off guard. I mean cinnamon barks as large a 1 inch and cardamom seed stocks.\nI think the taste is acquired.
