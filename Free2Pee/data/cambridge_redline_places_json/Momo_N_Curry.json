The spicy, creamy sauce is addictive. Definitely one of the best Tikka Masala’s I ever had!\n\nThe Chicken Curry is a common, stereotypical curry with really well-cooked chicken. The chicken was perfectly spiced and still juicy. If this place can nail a chicken curry and chicken tikka masala, I would assume everything on the menu is great.\n\nWe later went back and got the Lamb Curry (not pictured) which was fantastic. The lamb was well-cooked, tender, and spiced perfectly without a hint of the typical gamey lamb flavor.\n\nEach curry is specifically crafted to balance out every dish differently. The chicken curry is a lighter sauce which compliments the chicken (although still heavy in a sense) while the dark lamb curry sauce really balances the meaty, hearty flavor of the red meat.\n\nGoat momos - the thickness of the dough compared to the meat filling was the perfect ratio and the overall construction and seasoning of the momos was complimented by the flavor of the spiced goat meat. The texture of the momos was quite delightful. We highly recommend getting the chili momo version (+$1) which was a fantastic blend of coarsely chopped veggies in a sweet and spicy tomato-based sauce.\n\nOverall, this place feels like a home cooked meal - nothing fancy, just good comfort food. They give large portions so the price is very reasonable since you will get multiple meals out of one serving. Definitely check this place out as it will certainly cheer you up and help you beat the cold winter weather!","time":1630371856,"translated":false}],"secondary_opening_hours":[{"open_now":false,"periods":[{"close":{"date":"2023-02-19","day":0,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-19","day":0,"time":"1100"}},{"close":{"date":"2023-02-20","day":1,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-20","day":1,"time":"1100"}},{"close":{"date":"2023-02-21","day":2,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-21","day":2,"time":"1100"}},{"close":{"date":"2023-02-15","day":3,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-15","day":3,"time":"1100"}},{"close":{"date":"2023-02-16","day":4,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-16","day":4,"time":"1100"}},{"close":{"date":"2023-02-17","day":5,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-17","day":5,"time":"1100"}},{"close":{"date":"2023-02-18","day":6,"time":"2200"},"open":{"date":"2023-02-18","day":6,"time":"1100"}}],"type":"DELIVERY","weekday_text":["Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Thursday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Friday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Saturday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM","Sunday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM"]}],"serves_beer":false,"serves_dinner":true,"serves_lunch":true,"serves_vegetarian_food":true,"serves_wine":false,"takeout":true,"types":["restaurant","point_of_interest","food","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=1915013742601451953","user_ratings_total":185,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"431 Somerville Avenue, Somerville","website":"http://www.momoncurrysomerville.com/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=website"},"status":"OK"}
