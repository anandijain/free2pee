Ordered artichoke dip and it was lukewarm. It is served in a cold small skillet that I was able to hold in my hand. The waiter too it back and the kitchen made another that was perfect. I also ordered the carnitas tacos. They also came out lukewarm. My friend had the chicken sandwich, which he said was very good and hot. It came with a large amount of smash potatoes on the side. They also serve small rolls with a ricotta cheese spread that was very delicious. The main dishes took about an hour to be served. I didn't say anything about the tacos because by that time we were about ready to go. The waiter removed the dip from my bill, which was very nice and not expected.
