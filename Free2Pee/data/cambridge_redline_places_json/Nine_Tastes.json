Not sure if COVID forced a management change, most of the employees are different now and the restaurant had a new menu.\n\nUnfortunately things didnâ€™t change for the better for the restaurant. Few comments from a not-so-great dining experience today:\n\n1. Summer Lover, aka. Steak fries + small bowl of coconut soup for $10.95â€¦ I understand itâ€™s inflation time, but for about 15 slices of fries (one of them so over fried that they donâ€™t even bother to pick it out), and a bowl of soup as a dip? Who uses soup as fries dip? Itâ€™s too watery to have fries pick up any soup and the taste together is just strange. A 100% rip off.\n\n2. Their spicy level. I used to remember when nineâ€™ tasteâ€™s spicy level is legitimately spicy, with ðŸŒ¶, ðŸŒ¶ ðŸŒ¶, and ðŸŒ¶ ðŸŒ¶ ðŸŒ¶. The dish I ordered today with three pepper signs, tasted sour and sweet, nothing close to the level of spiciness indicated. One of Thai foodâ€™s essences is its spicy level that activates the taste buds. They failed miserably.\n\nOverall, the taste of Thai food has gone downhill since pre-COVID times. I suspect thereâ€™s a chance of management and of course, chefs as well, along with a hyper inflated menu items.\n\nAs a former loyal customer of Nine-Taste, I would not come here again.","time":1666408771,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Andrew Lu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117217713234783153396/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5E3qPI5X0Iei0pQsEYvxf0LUIgpMg49r190Dai=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Pretty solid as it goes for Thai food, quality and moderate price ($29) for good amount of food, smaller than average portions but tasty and moderately filling, more filling last time but same good quality (10/1/22).","time":1664781094,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Paul Monson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113728472227322738915/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp66c63wMrnxKveSsRWjx6MeLMIMPv8eLMmG7yzZjQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Very close to Harvard campus.
