(and to clarify, it wasn't a question of veggies on the side, it was de-selecting them from the order)\n\nI really want to leave a 5 star review, and in the past I have left glowing reviews on Facebook, but the quality has become really hit or miss. I order from them regularly, as this is one of my favorite local restaurants, so it really bums me out to have to write this review. I hope the owners see it and can do something to improve things.\n\nI have very annoying medical restrictions that mean I can't eat the raw tomatoes and lettuce they usually put on the shawarma. So, I select the option on the menu to have those left out. But these days it seems to be a 50/50 chance that they will completely ignore the actual order and just do the 'generic' fillings. So then I have to get a refund from Grubhub (losing the restaurant money, which I don't want to do), and take the whole thing apart to try to salvage what I can eat out of it.\n\nMy partner has her own restrictions, and isn't able to eat their sauces. So I put down a special request asking for the sauce on the side/no sauce inside. Again, there seems to be a 50/50 chance that they will just ignore it and put sauce inside. So then we get into 'refund and try to salvage something edible' mode again. I even asked the owner to put a \"no sauce\" option on the menu, rather than requiring customers to choose a sauce, but nothing came of it.\n\nAnd then on the flip side, *I* love the sauces. I pay for extra sauce and ask them to put it inside. Sometimes they do, but sometimes they barely put any sauce in at all. Or they'll put one sauce but not the other. It's very frustratingly inconsistent.\n\nI've had these issues happen on both quiet weekday nights, and on the normally busy Friday/Saturday nights, so it's not just a matter of it being too busy. It seems like it must be that certain employees take the time to read the order and others don't.\n\nI really hope the owners see this and can figure out what's going on. I love this restaurant, and I want to be able to reliably enjoy their food.","time":1673745499,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Marzouki","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102049783628464949094/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCm7JKVa43CG2WBnAcD1b8S_QC_83fjXJTz0B02z=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Noor Grill catered for our event and the food was mouth watering!
