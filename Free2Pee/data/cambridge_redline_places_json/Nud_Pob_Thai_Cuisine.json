There was an employee who would tease me about getting the same dish every time.  I miss her.  Nowadays, there are younger employees who speak better English, but they don't have the magic like the older lady.  Kah Prao with pork is also a dish I like.  It's minced meat with basil. The soups, salads, desserts are great tasting as well.  Reasonable prices and quick service.  Customers bus their own tables.  I first came to Nud Pob in 2001 when it was in a different location on Comm Ave, about - block east.  Customers had to walk down stairs into a very cramped space.  This location is such an improvement in terms of space, seating, and temperature, and the place takes credit cards now, just not amex.","time":1655897994,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Arwen Low","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114789807081264900676/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp40-apJ8mbxM7oX2lAidVEyaIyslUep-cpZqXjP=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Fuss-free dining of thai food here!
