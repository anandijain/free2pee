We are hoping this place will be great, as this is our first time and its take out. So, five stars based on how the ordering process was plus the person wanted to make us happy with our dietary requirements. We ordered various items mixing meat (me) and vegetarian (my wife). Also, very cool and amazing they offer brown rice which is very rare in a Chinese restaurant plus lots of Tofu options. This place had a steady traffic of take out orders while we waited and most of them said how much they like this place with one person specifically recommending Peking Ravioli.

I ordered Pad Thai.  I ordered it just like the last time I got it from here, but: different person running the place, different result.  I used GrubHub and, just like last time, asked for Tofu instead of chicken and to add broccoli.  This wasn't a problem the last time.  This time, the order was confirmed and I went to pick it up.  The person running the place, Jack, handed me the take out without telling me he didn't add tofu or broccoli.  As I was about to go, on a hunch [sometimes people don't read the order notes], I asked if broccoli and tofu were added.  THAT'S WHEN he told me No-- \"because I didn't pay enough.\"  For a minute, let's forget whether their entry in Grub Hub is misleading [when you order Veggie Pad Thai it asks for a meat choice -- being vegetarian, I choose tofu].  He presented me a printed menu which purports to charge as much for \"veggies\" on the Pad Thai as for chicken.  Let's forget that.  Notice what he didn't do?  He didn't contact me when he got the order to tell me he needed more money to add tofu or broccoli.  He didn't tell me when I got to the store and gave me my paper-bag sealed meal.  He only told me after I asked.  Had I not asked, I would have gotten home and discovered the incorrect meal then.  Not sure why a previous person running the store told me they work with customers to make sure customers enjoy their purchases.  I guess that person is no longer working here.  This guy's approach lost him my business.  And I'm a repeat customer for restaurants who keep my business.","time":1675820093,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Moesha Johnson (Moe)","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111291336624385572744/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp6ScLnHPADqsbRy0BLtRGHIlrXjztvwQ2Il39hdSQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I’m originally from NJ so I could be biased since the state is known for having the best food. Anyway, I really find it ironic that the restaurant is called “Number 1 Taste.” I literally didn’t taste anything as I was eating. First of all, I’m really shocked that the rice was dry. I’ve never experienced bad rice from a Chinese restaurant. If I don’t like anything else, I usually just eat the rice. I couldn’t even finish the rice this time! The rice tasted like bagged rice honestly. I’ve never experienced anything like this. It was just BAD! I also ordered lo Mein. I was able to stomach that. Needless to say, I will never be ordering from this place again. The food was really expensive to be at such low quality!!!
