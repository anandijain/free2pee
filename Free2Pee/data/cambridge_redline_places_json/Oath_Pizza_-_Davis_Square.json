The pizza gets 3 stars, I will explain later.\n\nRafael: In a world where I have walked into restaurants like Davio’s in Braintree and get ignored by hostess and staff, I truly appreciate that from the moment I step foot into the restaurant, you greeted and welcomed us. Yes, that is how it should be done.\n\nWhat I loved about you is that you explained the menu and ways we can customize our order. You also assured us that we could take our time. Thank you for that because dinning should be an enjoyable experience.\n\nYou were helpful and efficient. You went above and beyond bringing our pizza in boxes anticipating that we would take some of it home. You also brought us extra napkins (you always need those when you are eating with your hands.)\n\nI really hope this inclination to customer service takes you far. We need more of you in all industries.\n\nAs for the pizza…\nJesus, even Otto’s thin crust pizza is something I can hold and not have all the toppings fall off the pizza. A pizza is supposed to be able to be held with one hand. You have to eat Oath Pizza with utensils. Please make the pizza structurally strong and add more dough. I felt like I paid for a dough donut with a thin mesh for a center. I actually like pizza dough, so it would be nice to get more of it. It is only available in the large pizza and I wanted a personal size.\n\nAlso, it would be great if you offered cauliflower crust pizza.\n\nI love you, Rafael.\nOath Pizza, get it together.","time":1662900293,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Daniel Reis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114119528545566327035/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnbeyySRlEJw3HQCSvmSElIM0wVYJ5D3DFC_Xr4f04=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"I was a bit shocked. it's very good. I was expecting a gimmicky, overpriced, fashion Pizza. but although it is a bit overpriced, and they use these precooked crusts, it's delicious. the crusts are actually really good they bake / fry them in avocado oil before they put on the pizza ingredients. so it's quite thin and quite caloric. the personal Pizza is thin that is. but there's no denying the crust is yummy. and the ingredients are delicious. I always make my own pizza there and they have stuff like pesto sauce, balsamic vinegar, roasted cherry tomatoes, fresh oregano, roasted chicken etc etc very high quality and very good so the pizza one gets is delicious. if you want to spend around $15 for a one-person Pizza, September 2022, then it's the place to go","time":1663817347,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Quetzali Ramírez","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117820704337058383794/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCngJXumN4rsyLcWRID5htc8-VKX63_46IbdPXF5NyY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"This was a horrible experience.
