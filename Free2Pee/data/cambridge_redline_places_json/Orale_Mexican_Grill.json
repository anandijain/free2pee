I got the mixed fajitas (steak and chicken) and at first I had some good feelings towards it as I got it to go and it came in 3 full size to go containers. The meats in one / rice & sides in one / beans in another. Presentation was good across the board. After trying it all I wasn’t impressed with the meats, it had way too much cooking oil on it and the meat itself wasn’t high quality. I ended up throwing away half the chicken and meat due to it not being edible from how chewy it was. I will say the rice was some of the best I’ve ever had so not having the meat match it was bothersome. I will try this place again as I hope I got a bad batch so hopefully the next time around it’s edible.","time":1649913348,"translated":false}],"serves_beer":true,"serves_dinner":true,"serves_lunch":true,"takeout":true,"types":["restaurant","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=764377557257775148","user_ratings_total":236,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"847 Cambridge Street, Cambridge","website":"https://www.oralemexicangrillma.com/"},"status":"OK"}
