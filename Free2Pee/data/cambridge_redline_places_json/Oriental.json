If you're in this area I recommend going to roses Chinese. It's on Boston Ave in Medford right near Tufts. By the way I do not support this college they are extremely cheap and do not pitch in any money to the City of Medford to take care of the roads when they own most of the property in the city the very cheap a holes.
