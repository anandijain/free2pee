I tried the Carne Asada plate today. The steak is tender and well seasoned, although the cut is a little thin. The sides are comprehensive as the standard Mexican meal combo. All taste fresh. You need to pay extra two bucks for the Guacamole, so be aware. The food is pretty, although the portion looks alright. I definitely want more.\nHowever, what impressed me most about this place is not the food. It‚Äôs the inferior design. It looks very stylish. While keeping all the bright and clean elements as a modern cafe, the designer adds Mexican elements here and there to reflect the specialty of this place.

The tacos both chicken and steak were real good, the chicken was probably a little better but still tasteful. The chicken & steak bowl I got also was phenomenal, The rice and beans were great had very good flavors unlike some places that have salty beans and rice, this place had done it just right. The smoothies were surprisingly really good, the papaya smoothie was really pleasant not really sweet and the pi√±a colada was a little bit sweeter but it tastes just as good. The restaurant was nice and spacious felt cozy as well. The service is excellent and friendly and quick. Would put this place in the top 2 Mexican spots in just Medford.
