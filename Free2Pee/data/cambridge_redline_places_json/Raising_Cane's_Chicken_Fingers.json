They are plain chicken fingers with some decent sauce. The chicken wasn't crispy or flavorful or anything special on its own. The Texas toast and coleslaw are alright, but nothing special either. The crinkle-cut fries are terrible, bland, starchy, like they were frozen, but they are also my least favorite type of fries, so take my judgment with a grain of salt.\n\nService: They forgot to give me my drink in my combo order.\n\nFinal thoughts: There are so many good places to get chicken fingers in Boston and the surrounding areas instead. This place isn't horrible, but it's below average.
