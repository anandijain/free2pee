I'm not usually keen on breakfast/brunch-focused places, but I was pleasantly surprised by how Rosebud approaches their menu.  Their dishes are rich, creative, and well-balanced, and they do chicken and waffles extremely well. I'll definitely be back more in the future.\n\nThe first time I went, I had the chicken and waffles from the dinner menu ($20). I had never had chicken and waffles before this, but I knew this was no ordinary version. It had this maple crema sauce that tasted like caramel, a delightfully punchy calabrian chili layer, scallion/jalapeno/bacon garnishes, and extremely flavorful and juicy fried chicken. It was pretty incredible. My only complaint was that the waffle was pretty soggy from the get-go (maybe from the maple sauce) -- everything else was amazing. Not your typical diner food!\n\nThe second two times I went, I had the chicken and waffles from the brunch menu ($18). The waffles were much more crispy both of these times (maybe because there's higher waffle turnover in the brunch crowd), which I was happy about. The chicken was just as good and plentiful and the gravy was perfectly rich and flavorful. Super tasty. It's hard to say which version of chicken and waffles I prefer -- they're both so delicious!\n\nOn the sidelines, I also tried a couple of the eggs benedict options. I really appreciated the side salad for the kick of acidity (really helped balance out the rich chicken and waffles), and the eggs were perfectly poached.\n\nWe also tried a couple of cocktails during the brunches -- the blood orange mimosa and the boozy Capri Sun. The boozy Capri Sun was *delicious* and exactly what I'm looking for in a drink. The mimosa wasn't exactly my style (felt a bit watered down).\n\nOverall, I was really pleasantly surprised by Rosebud and it will certainly be my go-to brunch spot. The restaurant was a lot more packed during weekend mornings than the time I went in the evening -- I would definitely recommend brunch reservations! Would highly recommend any version of their chicken and waffles, and will be back for it myself soon enough. :)","time":1669947659,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Warren Bowman","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104383160681282634359/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCnZaBhiDkaWS4tCKOxZ78YD_D8RUUaoD4xn-0hn_A8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Great spot for brunch.
