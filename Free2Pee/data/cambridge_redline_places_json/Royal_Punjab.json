I would have personally preferred the Garlic Naan to taste more strongly of garlic, and ideally be both warmer and more risen (fluffier). Other dishes are clearly microwaved or reheated, and some are surprisingly lacking in quantity.\n\nOn the plus side, service staff were friendly and professional. The staff were also knowledgeable about the cuisine, and went out of their way to accommodate other guests.\n\nService varies visit-to-visit. I've had the food come out quickly in the past, but also more recently have had dishes served over a 20-minute span (and almost everyone waiting 5-10 minutes, including for pickup).\n\nHowever, the atmosphere was lacking with the otherwise comfortable environment being interrupted by the clear sounds of cooking & cleaning, and blaring television instead of fitting music. Cleanliness of the general area, dishes, and utensils could be improved.\n\nAlthough I haven't tried it yet, Royal Punjab offers a competitively-priced (read: rare find) lunch buffet for $9.95.\n\nEdit: Revised above to account for subsequent visit(s) and adjusted star rating.","time":1667177564,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jea Kim","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117730837401207768949/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmswfTg1g2YtaumI-HxIKqWa3kjLzTvtRfMq-MoZQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"10 months ago","text":"Typical budget Indian place that specializes in delivery food.\nI used to like getting deliveries from this place, and their biryanis were my favorites. Regardless of the meat I chose, all the biryanis I tried were great, but I later realized that the savory taste from the biryanis was too good to be based solely on the natural ingredients. I’m not sure if they actually use a lot of flavor enhancers, but a lot of the items I’ve tried had prominent artificial flavors. I also learned that the place isn’t very hygienic and stopped getting takeouts from them.
