Love the chill atmosphere and the staff. The food is really tasty (the spicy things are actually spicy!) and their tequila selection is great.\n\nLena is an excellent bartender, and chatting with her is the main reason we always sit at the bar. The TVs only matter to us when it's hockey season and the Bruins are playing. ;)\n\nTheir menu has the perfect amount of variety and isn't the same huge list you see at most Tex-Mex places. My husband loves their Pollo Verde burrito and their burger (which is made with better cuts of beef than most restaurant burgers). My favorites are the quesadilla appetizer, black bean nachos, and El Grande burrito.\n\n(FYI, the kitchen closes at 10pm but they're open until 11pm on Friday and Saturday.)","time":1661433506,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Aaron Williams","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110234845242939544694/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp4Vp8gwX3BCSdeuRVCzTgs8KOwGIp2W54ZhgRvE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 years ago","text":"Went here on a recommendation and I was not disappointed!
