All of our dishes were excellent. Don’t know why but we decided to start with french fries as an appetizer. They were hot and fresh and tasty. Having both ketchup and aïoli as sides is a nice touch. I had the faro bowl with salmon and it was a very generous portion. The salmon was a bit rare, so if you don’t want a little bit of sushi in your bowl, be sure to tell them. Hillary, our server, was excellent and attentive. We didn’t feel rushed and we were never wanting for anything.
