It’s a fairly large restaurant with lots of seating. There’s a portion of the restaurant that offers coffee, deli meats, cheeses and other produce. I came during a busy time (noontime) - there was about a eight minute wait to be seated. The only accommodations they have for solo dining is at the bar. My waitress is very kind and attentive, however due to the sheer volume of people, it took a while for me to get a drink and something to eat. I got one of the most popular items which was a lox pizza with cornbread (Mama’s pizza special). For the most popular item in their menu I have to say that it was okay. Cornbread crust was doing most of the work alongside a thick cut of cheese on top. While being somewhat tasty, it was unique I’ve never had anything like it before.\n\nFood - 12/20\nAtmosphere - 6/10\nService - 6/10\n\nTotal - 24/40","time":1648336381,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Reno Lucas","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109771342955484273993/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClxURCxit5qyDGxdAmF0pbbRwj5p236q2FM8AUGkPg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Excellent restaurant and deli.
