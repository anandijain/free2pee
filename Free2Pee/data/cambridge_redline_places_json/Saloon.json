Saloon is a hidden gem in the Davis Square area. Go down a few stairs to find out a tastefully decorated bar with plenty of seating places and a great vibe. We chose to come here because we were a big group and could book in advance. Cocktails were delicious, I enjoyed the Hen of the Woods. Staff was very friendly and gave us some good recommendations. Prices are fair. I loved the music playlist but it was a little too high because we seated below a loudspeaker.

Also, heads up because this is a speakeasy vibe there is no real signage for this spot.
