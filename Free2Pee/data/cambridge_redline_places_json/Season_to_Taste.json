We had our anniversary dinner here and chose to sit outside on the little private nook in the patio due to Covid, we were a bit skeptical of the cold (Dec 29 in Boston) but the heated lamp did the trick and the curtain really helped keep the heat in. Very very cozy.\n\nWe absolutely loved the wine and the list is pretty extensive. We had the gnocchi, the bone marrow, roasted carrots for starters. The carrots and marrow were excellent and the gnocchi was delish. The maitake mushrooms in the gnocchi were  incredibly delicious.\n\nFor the main course my husband had the braised short ribs and I got the mahi mahi. I loved loved the mahi mahi. My husband thought the ribs were delicious, but a tad under seasoned.\nOur dessert was such a delicious ðŸ˜‹ one, we had buttermilk panna Cotta with raspberry coulis and pistachios. Yum-yum.\n\nPlating was really great and you could see that the chef put his heart into cooking the dishes. Our server Paulina was really very sweet.
