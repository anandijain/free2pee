I had ordered vegetarian combination platter and the quantity of each side dish was so much LESSER than what is usually served at other Ethiopian restaurants and nobody charges for additional injera when you purchase a combo platter. I was charged extra $2 here. I also ordered samosa and only 1 mini samosa was served for $3. Other places serve 2 samosas.\n\nThe restaurant was otherwise well maintained. The food was served quickly. Washrooms were clean, injera was decent and the side dishes were okay( Curries were not creamy ). One side was missing but they served a boring salad instead.\n\nNot going here again.
