We had been on the road for almost a week when we came across this restaurant near Harvard campus. We loved the food and found it so close to home. Most impressive was the service and the hospitality of the staff. Special mention to Pranjal who makes sure all patrons are well taken care of. We were so impressed that we came back each day of rest of our stay, tried different entrees each day and enjoyed the diversity of menu.
