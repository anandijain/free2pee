It was 4:10pm and I had a train to catch at 5pm. Looking through the front glass windows I saw there was no line and I had never tried Smashburger before so I figured I would give it a try. I walked in, placed my order, (an original smashburger and fries), and sat down at a table while I waited for my takeout. While I was waiting a line began to form and it started getting busy. Next I looked and a woman walked in with her baby and the cashier went crazy over her. I didn't think much of it until the cashier picked up the baby and started taking orders with it in her arms. (I think the cashier knew the babies mother.) After waiting 10 minutes, people who ordered after me started getting their food before me. Mind you I had a train to catch. I stayed patient and then next thing you know this guy walked in with a speaker and starting dancing all over the place. People started recording it and I couldn't do anything but laugh. The babies mother all of a sudden started working on filling peoples orders in the kitchen. I didn't think she worked there! Just an all around bizarre experience. After waiting approximately 30 minutes I finally got my food and ran to the train station where I made the train and opened my bag to cold fries and an unappetizing burger. Moral of the story is wouldn't recommend for the food, but they put on a show. Good? No. Bizarre.","time":1667839402,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Stephanie Thomson (FANNIE)","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104999154541188259500/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClla10hFJlG5Art4bxYUVMl0SfkqEYD_v3L6gHF1kE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"8 months ago","text":"I really liked SmashBurger.
