We got a table with in 20 mins or so, the menu has a lot to choose from! I got the cornmeal pancakes and 3 sausage links and 3 over easy eggs, my sister got buttermilk pancakes with 3 over easy eggs and crispy bacon, and her husband got pancakes with strawberries & powdered sugar and 3 over easy eggs with Linguiça sausage well done. All pancakes where light fluffy and cooked perfectly cornmeal grilled tasted so good, the sausage links cooked just as requested really delicious, the Linguiça was delicious and cooked well done as requested, the bacon was crispy as requested (1 bacon strip wasn't) but the rest was just how my sister loves her bacon crispy and delicious it was! All eggs orders where cooked perfectly over easy can't ask for any better, we got raisin bread toast & my sis got wheat toast, toasted just right! The service was excellent the servers work well in a busy service rush the place was packed and a line growing outside. The self service station for fresh squeezed orange juice was refreshing! The cold brew coffee was great the have a endless selection of syrups flavors for your coffee, hot or tea also! I will be coming back to try something else on the menu!
