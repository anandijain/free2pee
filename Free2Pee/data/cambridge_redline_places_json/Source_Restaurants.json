It also has plenty of outdoor seating. The service was also great. We went there right before they closed their kitchen, but they still took a large order from us. The food however was so-so especially with the high price point. I ordered the chicken wings. They were not very flavorful and also a little dry. The other dish was alright. I feel like this is a place that you pay for the atmosphere and not for the taste. Three of us spent about $120 including tips. It's a place I would come once just for experience.","time":1659392059,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kathy D","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108572646020757568872/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp40rYbs6WWI0YgaDNEc-G1BkI6hiSuCEZUFoF1w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Great pizza and salad restaurant.

He was pretty intrigued by the deconstructed grilled cheese but requested to have the egg taken off and was verrrry specific about it to the server. The food came with the egg literally on the bread and instead of pointing it out, we just moved it out of the plate cuz we were all super hungry.\nTheir pizza? Sub par. Nothing to rave about. If anything, both pizzas had burnt crusts. I love some nicely roasted crusts but definitely not blackened.\nThe drinks were $14 and perhaps the picture would show how tiny they were!!!\nGiving the place two stars only for the soufflé pancakes. They were the main reason we visited and they fit our expectations. But they gave us the pancakes before the pizza. So service is a thumbs down for me all the way.\nAbsolutely not worth the hype.
