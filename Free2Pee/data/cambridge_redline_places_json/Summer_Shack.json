The staff was very friendly and attentive, although we had to wait a bit for the food as the place was packed.

There were at least three or four servers attending to other people and they had to of seen me.\n\nHowever, I had the Bluefish and it was really good.  The bluefish itself was cooked perfectly and they added some spices that crept onto the rice and vegetables that made for a great taste.  I haven't had Bluefish in decades so I was really amazed how good it was prepared.\n\nGetting service for another beer was also like pulling teeth.
