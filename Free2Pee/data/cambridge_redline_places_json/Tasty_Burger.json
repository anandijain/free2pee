It's a \"not so bad at midnight\" burger. I'm in Boston for the weekend and needed to get food. Tasty Burger was open and just a 6 minute walk from my hotel. This is probably an awesome spot if you're drunk and just left a club or party. Places like this are necessary. I got a double cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and pickles. The bacon was extra as expected (I think I paid $2 or 3 bucks for it). Charging for bacon is expected. What I didn't expect was 50 cent for BBQ sauce. No big deal but still a shocker. I also paid extra for a side of ranch for my fries and paid the upcharge for a combo. With all the extras, my double cheeseburger combo was $17.95. The wait for the burger was about 35 minutes. The ranch was missing, the fries were cold, and the coke was over-carbonated. It's 12:30am...I should have gone to sleep. The burger was ok. It reminded me of Jack in the Box except the bacon wasn't crispy. Anyway, I don't live in Boston but if I did and it was late and nothing else was open, I'd definitely eat here again. It was ok.","time":1659849176,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Rose Davis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104341696202006351193/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5JiBOE8lsphdmAby2x6sfChBwODtnPqvMr4HVGtA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"Visited it for the first time with the kids.
