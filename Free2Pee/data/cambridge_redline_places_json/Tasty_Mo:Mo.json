The noodles are toasted, veggies roasted and glazed and the mildly acidic flavor of the true street chowmein.\n\nChilli Momos were equally delicious. Most places have cheap lettuce fillings, here however you get a good balance of Paneer with it. -1 star just cz Chilli Momo's orange sauce tasted more tangy sweet than chilli (noticed a couple roasted red bell peppers, but they ain't chilli).\n\nWe called to place an order and picked it up.
