Overall, most of the menus I tried were bland and under-seasoned. The crispy pad Thai and the fried calamari were uninteresting, and the Thai spring rolls were also underwhelming. Basil fried rice with beef was the most flavorful dish, but it was still lacking some spice. Sweet chili sauce on the side definitely helped, but it would’ve been better if more options for sauce were offered.\nProbably wouldn’t order from here again, but given the price, it actually exceeded my initial expectations.","time":1652671103,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Christine Rader","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102338519393597767171/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClrC17-Jme-yzN0kgUAFCU6c-C8nHIow_ryGRVJcA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I ordered the Thai Basil tofu lunch, it was delicious and portion size was perfect.
