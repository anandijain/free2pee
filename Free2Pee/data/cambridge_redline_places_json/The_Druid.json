It properly embodies all the best features of pub-culture with excellent food and drinks. We ordered the Shepard’s Pie and the Fish & Chips, both were excellent! The Guinness was good and the ginger beer had a proper kick of spice to it rather than a sweet aftertaste.\n\nThe Shepard’s Pie was proper with lamb rather than beef. The lamb was tender and well-cooked, the vegetables were coarsely chopped and the mash potatoes were perfect. It did not have the typical vegetables you would expect in a Shepard’s pie (carrots and peas), rather, it was thick-cut hearty root vegetables that tied the dish together really well and would hold you through the cold months of winter. This is one of the best Shepard’s Pie’s that we have enjoyed this side of the pond.\n\nThe Fish & Chips arrived in a bundle of newspaper (cute) and was perfectly fried fresh cod. While I wish the chips were double or triple fried (personal favorite), the overall dish was great with fantastic homemade tartar sauce that offered a bit of sweetness to the savory dish. Really, I could not get enough of the tartar sauce.\n\nThe decor is well thought out with even a nod to Arthurian legends and local artistry tying the community together. There was a live band when we arrived playing tasteful Irish music, the golden retriever was a nice touch too. We will definitely return here as we loved the vibe, food, and live music!","time":1630370777,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kent Wangsness","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118378163611956221079/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp4EGkmgq0PDaIVI0CLKjbmxhEViYJHw-MkNkSK1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Great visit for this out of towner, fish and chips were amazing with large portions, appropriately wrapped in newspaper.
