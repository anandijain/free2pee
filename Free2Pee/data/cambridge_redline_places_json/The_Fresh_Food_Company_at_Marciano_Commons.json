Most of these experiments fail miserably, leaving poor students to find alms at restaurants near by. The omelets tend to be rubbery, but the breakfast food is decent.  The lunch service is a hit or miss- and in general, the burgers are overcooked and the entrees are under seasoned and bland. Dinner is normally terrible. It's still better than most dining halls though.\n\nSome of the staff are genial, polite, and nice. Many members are apathetic, but that is normal with most food service jobs.
