We enjoyed both quite a bit.  The brussel sprouts side was a bit underflavored and relied too much on the bacon to do all the seasoning.  The atmosphere is nice and the price point is very reasonable, given the area and the food.  Our service was friendly as well.\n\nThe one drawback is that we were told we couldn't sit outside because too many people had reservations.
