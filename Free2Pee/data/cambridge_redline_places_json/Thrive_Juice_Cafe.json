The Breaky is easily one of the best vegan meals I've ever had. Getting it with extra maple aioli on the side is a sweet/savory match made in heaven. Also a great price and fills me up well. I ordered their Thanksgiving meal and shared with a coworker. Our non-vegan friend was jealous and wished we ordered more! Will be making the 20 minute drive once a week because they simply can't miss the mark here. One great addition to the menu would be gluten free vegan bread!!","time":1671457786,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stanley","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110572290560400900928/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCkUMrmFgHxNUVv32FGc-rHigWG9VCj3y6NnrwL3cA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"This place rocks!
