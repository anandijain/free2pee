Menu prices are very reasonable. Spinach artichoke dip came out piping hot with very warm pita bread slices. Our entrees came out so fast. My pulled pork sandwich was tender and filling. Sweet potato fries were cooked just right. I am very picky about overcooked sweet potato fries. Cole slaw was not tasty to me, and I was glad that I ordered it on the side and not on my sandwich.\n\nMy husband ordered the “Pig Pile” which was a huge heaping of homemade Mac N Cheese with pulled pork, bacon, and onion strings.

This place was between our homes and fit the criteria (full bar, diverse selection of food)\n\nAs you enter the restaurant it is open and welcoming. Our server, Clenilson D was personable and knowledgable with the questions we asked.\nWe started with drinks and an order of fries while we decided on lunch.  The fries were insane.  They were hand-cut, cooked to perfection and seasoned with the right amount of salt. The malt vinegar elevated them to the next level.\nFor our meal we each ordered a burger.  I ordered the bacon cheddar burger, while my husband and friend each ordered the Tavern Burger.  The burgers were excellent and highly satisfying.\nWe finished our meal with a cappuccino, which was also excellent.\n\nWe planned on leaving, but decided to stop at the bar and have 1 more drink.  The bartender, I think her name was Aubrey, was friendly and helpful as we tried to decide on what to order for shots.  After her description of the Peppermint Martini we ordered those. They were rimmed in crushed candy cane and had a mini candy cane on the side. They made me feel like we were in a Christmas movie.  Probably a Lifetime Christmas movie because Hallmark isn't big on alcohol drinks.\n\nThis will be our go to for our annual Christmas lunch with our friend and we may even go down during the year.\n\nMerry Christmas and thank you for the great meal and drinks.","time":1671834332,"translated":false}],"serves_beer":true,"serves_dinner":true,"serves_lunch":true,"serves_wine":true,"takeout":true,"types":["restaurant","meal_takeaway","bar","food","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=9015134897663793829","user_ratings_total":386,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"201 Massachusetts Avenue, Arlington","website":"https://towntavern.net/","wheelchair_accessible_entrance":true},"status":"OK"}
