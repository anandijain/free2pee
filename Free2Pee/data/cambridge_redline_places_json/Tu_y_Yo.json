Best Mexican food I have had in the Boston area. The restaurant is cozy and homey. The staff was very friendly and helpful in suggesting items from the menu. The food was absolutely phenomenal. We tried the fried plantains, tamales, Pechugas en Salsa de Chile Poblano, and Nopales con Cerdo. Everything was hot, fresh, and seasoned perfectly. We also tried the horchata, which was spicy and delicious but overly sweet. We will definitely be coming back here again and we look forward to trying their brunch menu.","time":1650073188,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Manny M.","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105758507875846189643/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCkVv593vFcqS-LPew6-WEyNSxhRViTd_etrX_i-sg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Really nice cozy little restaurant in a area that’s a little bit quieter than Davis.
