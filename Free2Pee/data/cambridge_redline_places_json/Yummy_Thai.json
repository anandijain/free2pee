($5.95)\nThe other thing was Eggplant Basil w/shrimp $13.50 it was just ok, little bl taste and weird texture (and I normally love eggplant in any variations).\nWe weren’t ask for a level of spice for non of our dishes, but when our friend (who was late came in) they reassured her that they make curry ($11.50 - $14.95) with low spice level.
