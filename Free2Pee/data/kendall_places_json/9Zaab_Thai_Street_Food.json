I plan to come back here for a 3rd time before I leave. For those who like Thai food you must try their boat noodle, their drunken noodle, and their crispy pork belly with a chili sauce (I forgot the name and it was a tad salty for my liking but still very yummy where I finished the whole plate).","time":1634403591,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jeff W","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101704677518123411676/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp7XCXty5FYPVuhwqbfUKsVMF9xHNQ24uBjRI0Lf=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This was my first time eating at this restaurant.

I order several dishes including the som Tum thai, som tum pu plaa, fish larb, vegie dumplings, oyster egg fried, sticky rice, tom yum soup and shrimp fried rice. The ingredients used for some of the dishes and the final product were 100 percent as you would get it in Thailand. Although I recommend them to use Asian long beans and not french beans for papaya salad. Can the flavor and recipe be improved, I believe so in some cases. But eating in this restaurant I would say you get very close to what you get on Thailand. The menu is very interesting with a strong focus on Thai street style food. There have some classic Thai street side items in their menu. This good spot to get a good exposure to authentic street style food from Thailand. You can also get a good array of sea food options which is expected in a Boston restaurant. The fish larb was very good. The Tom yum soup was average.  There is a good options for noodles dishes  both soup and fried. A place I would definitely return to next visit to Cambridge. The owner khun the extremely nice and friendly. I speak Thai fluently we had nice chat about food and took a lot of interest in my feedback for the food.  Definitely a good place for a night out with friends and family.  I would rate the food 3.5 and the service 4, venue is a 4 too. Overall rating round up to 4.","time":1637622464,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Claire","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112197814270062306901/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp4CXhTeAtK8HVLDzOsxvU21QKicWgZ91UyvPmSg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"This is second restaurant amazed me in Boston area. The first is Neptune which is a top seafood restaurant. You can see how I like this Thai food restaurant lol. The spice is used so different but give you a  brand new experience. I felt I sat on a tropical beach when I tasted the noodle soup it seems there is passion fruit flavor in it. We randomly ordered several dishes and they are all flavorful!The fried chicken is so tasty and the lemon flavor inside is 👍 price is reasonable and when you order online there is 10% off and more than $45 dine in they will send a scallion pancake for free.
