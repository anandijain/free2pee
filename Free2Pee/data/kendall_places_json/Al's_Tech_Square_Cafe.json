Now you no longer need to go into Boston to get it! The Kendall area had a sore lack of affordable quick lunch options, and almost nowhere to get a good sub, now Al's has saved the day.\n\nI eat lunch at Al's several days a week, over 50 times at this location since it opened in March.\n\nSubs are large or small, but the small is larger than anyone else's large and will fill any big appetite. Order hot subs in the line to the right, and cold subs to the left. They also serve soups, salads, and chicken kabob meals at the far left line.\n\nHere are some of my favorites:\n1. Roast Beef with Mayo and BBQ (and provolone, lettuce, and basil)\n2. Turkey & cheese add bacon (a ton of tasty crispy bacon makes it well worth the extra cost)\n3. Chicken salad add bacon (with lettuce, cheese, and oregano). The best chicken salad sandwich you will ever have.\n4. Steak Bellino with american cheese. A decent steak and cheese that melts right into the fresh bread.\n5. Hot Pastrami (\"swiss and spicy\" with swiss cheese and mustard)\n6. Chicken Eggplant Parmesan. As the chicken is not breaded, the breaded eggplant adds that needed flavor\n7. Pesto Chicken Kabobs. When I'm not in the mood for a sandwich. Awesome homemade pesto chicken breasts on a bed of rice, plus a salad and a loaf of fresh bread.\n8. Meatball parm sub. Highlighted by their excellent homemade sauce.\n\nThe chili is also that perfect balance of flavor and spice, meat and beans, and can be added on the side for a big meal or good enough on its own.\n\nService is still very quick without the insanity and yelling of the downtown locations. There is just enough seating inside, and tables on the sidewalk on nice days.","time":1500917907,"translated":false}],"serves_beer":false,"serves_brunch":false,"serves_lunch":true,"serves_wine":false,"takeout":true,"types":["restaurant","point_of_interest","food","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=2174255351774868960","user_ratings_total":168,"utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"600 Technology Square, Cambridge","website":"http://www.alscafes.com/index.php","wheelchair_accessible_entrance":true},"status":"OK"}
