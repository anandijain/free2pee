The plates were spiced to perfection. Each dish was unique in flavor and spicy to an enjoyable level. Also the honey wine was amazing, so smooth.\n\nThe service: I came with a group of friends, one of which did not feel comfortable eating with her hands. When she asked for a spoon the waiter laughed her off. She ended up having almost nothing to eat that night. What she did manage to eat, she ended up enjoying. However I would caution more reserved guests and make them aware that they will not be accommodated in this restaurant.\n\nLike the other reviews said, there's only one waitress so don't expect to get your food quickly if you get in during peak hours.","time":1652239332,"translated":false},{"author_name":"pranitha r","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105583871039423549846/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClee2jPsNl-C_3Yspi51nEKdzwNWUV9MlnBxeNWdw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This is a great and warm place to eat.
