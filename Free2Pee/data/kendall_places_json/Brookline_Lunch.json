Enjoyed every order from here. I personally do like Baklava, so I was willing to try the interesting sounding Baklava Pancakes. It's just that, Backlash in the form of pancakes. If you enjoy both, this is a great option. First time trying Turkish coffee. I like drip coffee or V60. This was very cool, the coffee is given to you in a little pot, once the coffee grounds settle to the bottom you carefully pour it into the coffee cup, be sure to go slow to avoid getting too many coffee grounds. It has a very distinct flavor. I've never tried a Chick A’la King and wow this was delicious. Lots of spices but not over bearing, and creamy but not too thick. It was made well!

He invited us to stay and taste from his stew and we had a very nice chat. He later sent us home with some homemade spicy sauce.
