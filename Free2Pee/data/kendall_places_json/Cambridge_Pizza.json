Surely there must be a mistake. This place has been an MIT staple for two decades and is loved by the students.\n\nTheir pizza is akin to 2Bros Pizza in New York City. You get huge slices. And there's just something special about the pizza dough. The crust is more like a buttery/bready texture, more similar to the crust of a Chicago deep dish pizza.\n\nNo, they're not a fancy sit-down restaurant, but they sure make a damn good slice of pizza! Plus, they're open late until 4am on weekends!
