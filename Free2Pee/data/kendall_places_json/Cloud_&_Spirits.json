It has been on my want-to-go list for a while now. The menu was very limited, and we ordered everything except the rip eye. I had to give it to the chef. Everything but the curry meatballs were phenomenal. I know it is so hard to get everything right, but they (almost) did it. We were so happy with every single dish , and couldn’t believe our last dish, curry meatballs, was so bad that I couldn’t swallow it. I still gave it a five-star because I highly recommend it to everyone.\n\nEverything else\nThe decor was playful. It certainly matches the name, cloud & spirit.

One sip and it gets your blood rising with a kick. It is smooth ,sweet and strong. The ambiance in this spot is a cool vibe with great music.

The best drink in my opinion was the Crimson Garden. The ingredients for it sound simple enough, but the proportions and preparation made it a memorable drink that rose above it’s station. All the food we got was very good, but the standout was the Fried Chicken. I didn’t even get a chance to take a photo because I devoured it immediately! Overall this is a great place to go (especially for a date), but it can be expensive for the amount of food you get( excluding the Fried Chicken) so just keep that in mind.\n\nCame back here for brunch and I thought it was incredible!
