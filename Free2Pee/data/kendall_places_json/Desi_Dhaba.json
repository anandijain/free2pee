I had the AYCE lunch buffet which was $16.  The food was fresh and flavorful, the service was attentive even though the server was on a business call -- he made sure my water glass was filled and he asked me how I like everything.  Matter Paneer, Vegetable Mix, Spinach Saag, Chicken  Curry, and Vegetable Samosa were all good.  Chicken was the only meat represented at the buffet, as there were at least four chicken dishes there.  I enjoyed the complimentary chai and the rasgulla dessert, which a dumpling made of soft cottage cheese with rose sugar syrup.  Naan was plain and tasty.  Clean dining room and bathroom.  The restaurant's address is listed as Mass Ave, but it's on Main Street.
