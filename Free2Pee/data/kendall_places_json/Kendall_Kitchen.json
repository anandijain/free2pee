I ordered for pickup (curbside) via their online website this morning, but when I arrived at the place and called to notify that I've arrived, the staffs said \"What do you want. You have to come in to the store to get your order.\"\nWhen I finally stepped into the place and asked the staffs about the issue, they condescendingly ignored all my questions and just gave me the food. It would've been much better if they simply acknowledged their mistake, but they refused to say not even a word about it. They need to understand that what constitutes a great restaurant is not only good food, but also pleasant and satisfying service. Food may taste okay, but if they provide service that deteriorates the mood of their customers, no one would be able to enjoy them. Failure to admit their mistakes and unpleasant service clearly signifies that they don't care about their customers and further goes to show that they aren't attentive to detail.\nCambridge is a large town and there are plenty of other places that offer a similar selection of menus but with better service. I would highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.","time":1619036479,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Samantha Clark","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115733851323977207811/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WClHqRd_PgcYwvdmTF5UbA_52g3YZFmiZr8gQdVkS-E=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Everything I have eaten here has tasted incredible.

I contacted them about getting food for my office space and Hratch got right back to me with a reasonable quote, my food was on time to pick up, and everyone at my office was so impressed with their breakfast sandwiches and fruit cups.
