The people in Cambridge are an eclectic bunch, and the never ending train of students, tourists, confused parents, dog walkers, patrons and vagrants are a form of entertainment you can only get in the middle of Harvard Square.  The food is what you'd expect and it comes out pretty fast even at the busiest times.
